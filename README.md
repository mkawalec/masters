Michal's Masters Project
=======

These are the sources for my Masters Project in Physics @ University of Edinburgh. As of the time of writing, the project is a clever integrator for a nonlinear numerical equation, for more info see the paper.

## C++ part

The C++ part uses cmake, so to configure and compile use (from inside of C directory)

    mkdir build ; cd build ; cmake .. ; make -j3
